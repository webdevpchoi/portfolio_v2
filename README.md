# Phillip Choi | Portfolio Rundown

Built on [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) for maximum performance and scalability.

Not really much else to say for a portfolio README, but feel free to take a look around and at how my environment is set up.

Thanks for dropping by! ðŸ‘‹
